# Charting-Library---Android-SDK-Legacy

Native Android SDK for the [ChartIQ JavaScript Library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

This SDK has been designed to support a [basic application](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App-Legacy) and may need to be extended to enable more elaborate implementations, which can be done by adding code to invoke JavaScript functions directly.
