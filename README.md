# Charting-Library---Android-SDK-Legacy

Native Android SDK for the [ChartIQ JavaScript Library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

This SDK has been designed to support a [basic application](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App-Legacy) and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations, which can be done by adding code to invoke JavaScript functions directly.

## Requirements

Version 7.0.5 to 7.5.0 of the ChartIQ library.

**Note:** Support for this SDK has ended as of Version 8.2.0 of the ChartIQ library. Please use the [ChartIQ-Android-SDK](https://github.com/ChartIQ/ChartIQ-Android-SDK) instead.

## Sample app

A sample app created using this SDK is located in the [Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App-Legacy](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App-Legacy) repository.
